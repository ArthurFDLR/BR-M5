# BR-M5: A custom Bluetooth Remote for Canon DSLRs

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

The Canon M50 is an excellent Mirrorless camera. However, it misses a descent timelapse mode, one that can do a long exposure. The shutter speed option in M50's timelapse mode is indeed limited to 1/30s.

Furthermore, the M50 doesn't have any shutter release port to plug the classic intervalometers, nor does it supports IR remote. The only options are BLE, WiFi, or tethering tools.
Since the only Bluetooth remote available - BR-E1 - lacks intervalometer mode, let's develop our own. Fortunately, *M5Stack* has a nice little inexpensive development board that perfectly fits our needs, the [M5Stick-Cplus](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit?variant=35275856609444).
